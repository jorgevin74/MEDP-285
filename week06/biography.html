				<h2>The History of Kendrick Lamar</h2>

				<a href="https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Kendrick-Lamar/631144"><h3>Early Life:</h3></a>

				<p>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17th, 1987 in Compton California, His parents were originally from Chicago however, escaped due to increased gang culture on the rise. Kendrick and his siblings had to live in Section 8 housing which is known as Housing Choice Voucher Program, allowed low income families to be given assistance in finding a home. As a young student he was always infatuated with the idea of writing poetry and was given many encouragements to do so from his teachers such as Mr.Inge, his seventh grade teacher. As he grew up he then used those rhymes he wrote to create mixtapes that were under the label of Top Dawg Enterntainment, he would then go on to drop two more mixtapes in the next couple of years Training Day(2005) and C4(2009). </p>

				<a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/kendrick-lamar"><h3>Rise to Fame:</h3></a>

				<p>In 2010 Kendrick released his mixtape Overly Dedicated (which you can currently find on streaming services) that garnered the attention of many people, one of them being Dr.Dre. Because of this he worked with him on his debut studio album Section.80 on July 2nd, 2011. It had hit singles such as “A.D.H.D” and “HiiiPower”. He also around the time formed a rap group with other rappers who were also in Top Dawg Entertainment’s label which consisted of Jay Rock and Schoolboy Q to name a few. After the release of the album, he garnered even more attention from others with big names such as Drake, Lil Wayne and The Game. In October 22nd, 2012 Kendrick released his first major label studio album titled good kid, m.A.A.d city and was recieved with critical success and wide acclaim from many reviewers. It allowed for him to appear as a musical guest on many tv shows with Saturday Night Live being one of them.The album spoke on street culture and gang violence and how that can have an influence on a young mans life. In 2013 he was featured on a song called Control with a verse that stunned his and many others fanbases wirth a bold challenge to many of his peers to see who was the best MC to do it and of coursed it garnered many responses critiquing his claims.

				<p>The beef between drake and himself garnered so much attention to them, many audiences (including myself) would eagerly wait for their back and forth responses to see what more they could say about one another. The battle ended with Drake releasing his last response (officially) titled The Heart Pt 6. After that Kendrick Lamar has made a music video for Not Like Us and in said video officially showed off a preview of a track which would come to be known as “Squabble Up” off his album, GNX which was kept hidden at the time. He then had his Pop Out Concert in the summer of 2024 where had a lot of West Coast Artists perform songs they desired with Kendrick Lamar being the headliner and final performer officially performing songs such as Euphoria and Not Like Us for the first time. After that it was relatively quiet until on November 22, 2024 he surprised released his 6th studio album titled GNX which was met with critical acclaim and success from his fans and others alike receiving major success with hit songs such as “Luther”. He would eventually go on to get 5 nominations for Not Like Us and unsurprisingly won all of his award nominations and went on to perform the Super Bowl this year as well. What’s next for Kendrick Lamar is an upcoming tour with SZA to perform songs off of GNX and possibly a small break after that given that this is the longest he has been in the spotlight but only time will tell what he has in store for the future.</p>
