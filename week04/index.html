                    <h2>&diams;An Introduction To The Persona Series</h2>
                    <p> Persona is an JRPG (Japenese Role Playing Game) where you follow the main protagonist, yourself navigating a new surrounding where you meet new friends and learn about each and every one of them and the personal struggles that they face. In some way or another you’ll eventually learn of another world where these “Persona’s” exist which give the protagonist and his friends abilities to be able to combat monstrous entities and help save the world or town, depending on the setting. Each game has it’s own different identity and message. Persona 3’s color choice is blue, 4 is yellow and 5 is red. The color choices are not just because they look pretty but rather because they are colors that are associated with the main character and perfectly describes how they act. Blue representing sadness and calm, yellow being optimism and red being anger, love and rebellion. The development team Atlus, who are owned by Sega, play around with each main color theme and use the color palette to be able to perfect their UI and make sure that any player that picks up these games can easily access any of the 3 games and make it easy to understand for the average user. In this website, we will go over the history of Persona 5 Royal’s UI system and how the development came to be and why their design choices became integral to the series identity.</p>
