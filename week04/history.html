                    <h2>&diams;<a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-panel-concept-development-ui/">A look back at the history of Persona's UI: </a></h2>
                    <p>To understand the choices as to why Persona 5 Royal is the way it is, we would have to go back in time to when Persona 3 FES came out. That game’s whole mission was to bring in a whole new audience and innovating how the series plays out all whilst doing it on a small budget because at the time the Persona series wasn’t as big and popular as it is now. The tools that were used to be able to create and enhance the UI are apps such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects. In the creative process for coming up with the UI and how it will look like, the designers have to come up with a main color that will be used all throughout the game before any further development can continue. In Persona 5’s case it is red. In other games like 3 and 4, there were sub-colors used all throughout the game to make it easier for the user to be able to navigate through the game and take in the information well, However 5 doesn’t traditionally have sub-colors as much as 3 and 4 do in the sense that they wanted the red to really pop out and although it does have some sub-colors, it really is only when you’re seeing the MP and HP and some small other details here but it is mainly black, white and some hints of gray scattered around too. A lot of developers in Atlus’ team do want to eventually push the limits of UI and keep making more intuitive and playful designs and that’s what works really well not just in 5 but the series in general.  </p>

                    <h2>&diams;<a href=https://ridwankhan.com/the-ui-and-ux-of-persona-5-183180eb7cce>The UI and UX of Persona 5 Royal: </a></h2>
                    <p>Persona 5’s use of the whole red/white/black and gray color scheme demonstrate rebellion which coincidentally fits with the theme of the game. We can also take a look at it’s typography as it uses a sort of punk english font to really make it stand out and unique from any other game out there. It’s a bold technique that really captures the anger and youthfulness that a lot of the characters have in the game that translates well enough into the design choices that were made specifically for that reason.It uses multiple elements of design, typography, color and animation to name a few, that really make the user experience flow well and we see that with their design choice and specifically allocating a button on the playstation or xbox controller with an action that can be performed rather than using the d-pad or the left analog stick to scroll up and down to perform an action. This really helps the user be able to understand what button does what action and makes the game flow really nicely so that the user isn’t stuck there scrolling between choices but rather can instantly click on a button and be taken to take part in the action. In gameplay you’ll also notice that when you attack an enemy and figure out their weakness, a bold red text above their head shows “WEAK” to show to the user that this element whether it be fire,wind,ice,lightning is strong against this type of enemy. Finally once the battle ends, it shows a reward screen where you follow a red zig zag where each sharp edge shows you the amount of EXP gained, money obtained and any items received during the battle. Each having their own unique design and making it clear to the user what they got and how much of a certain item or cash they got. These UI choices, to a casual player, wouldn’t be as interesting as it is but seeing as how designers and developers have to understand and make sure the information they want to display is shown to the players. It really makes you appreciate the design choices that Atlus went with in Persona 5 Royal.</p>

                    <h2>&diams;<a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-interview-ui-design-sound-music/">An Interview with an Atlus developer on their UI design: </a></h2>
                    <p> This interview really gives with Persona 5’s Art Director Masayoshi Sutou gives an insight as to how the creative process for making the UI comes together. He says that he tends to read books and magazines and as well as going out for a walk seeing whatever thing out on the streets that can give him inspiration. The stylish UI that came to be in Persona 5 Royal was actually introduced over in another game released by Atlus called Catherine. It was the first game the developers experimented with the UI and UX design of the game and it fully came into fruition in P5. The developers actually do things manually instead of relying on other tools first when creating the UI which some tend to see it as a bit inefficient, they are able to work really well with this sort of style. To finalize, they really wanted the style and identity of P5 to be reflective of our own world so that it can be slightly realistic in it’s own way and they wanted to recreate the specific locations in Japan into the game. Making sure the developers work together instead of by themselves is important to get everyone’s input and be able to get the concepts and the designs for the UI before actually implementing it in the game. </p>
