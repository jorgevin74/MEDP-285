                    <p>
                        In the article, it is discussed that although the stories for these games were performing really well it wasn’t selling as well as they hoped too so they decided to put more emphasis on the marketing of the games and as well as putting money into the UI design so that it can attract more players into checking out the game purely based on it’s design and color scheme before. If you aren’t familiar with the Persona series, it is essentially JRPG that started out in the late 90’s and eventually releasing multiple titles with the latest one being a remake of Persona 3 FES that came out in 2008 for the playstation 2. The developers were able to use color to be able to convey it’s identity to the player, in this case Persona 3 uses blue all throughout the game, 4 uses yellow and 5 uses red and these distinct colors are able to let the user know and associate each game with a certain color. They were able to use sub colors that were layered underneath the red color to make sure to display any key information to the user and that can be shown in the gallery with different examples as to how they used different colors besides red to be able to convey the characters HP and MP and any relevant information.</p>
