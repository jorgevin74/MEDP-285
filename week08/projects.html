            <h3>Photoshop Sliders: </h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>First Slider:</b> These sliders were all made using Photoshop. They were taken from an actual poster that had previously been created. However, a new design background had to be implemented, and organizing how the text should be spaced out and placed onto the slider was another task in itself. So what I was able to do was find another background that was similar to the original poster and then implement it as the background of the Photoshop file and insert it into the page. I then was able to export the Photoshop file and head to WordPress where I uploaded the file onto the slideshow section of the webpage where all sliders are placed and created a new post where the slider would be implemented in the homepage for users to know that the Emerging Media event was taking place at that time.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Second Slider:</b> The next slider was used to congratulate Rommel Genciana for his work on Lakota Nation Vs. United States. This one wasn’t difficult to adjust, all it took was to get the image of Rommel and use the elliptical tool on Photoshop to trace out a round image and implement it into the already created Photoshop file where I adjusted the text for who won the award and what did they win it for. It is currently up on the Hunter College Film & Media Website.</li>

            <h3>Photoshop Posters / WordPress : </h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>First Poster:</b> The first poster I made is for an upcoming Journalism Info Session. It was relatively simple although what I had to do was simply adjust the text in the middle so that the date and time for the meeting is similar to the upcoming one. What was also necessary was to create barcodes so that when the posters were printed out, students could scan them and inquire about the In-Person event or the Online Event. After that, a pdf file was also made so that if users don’t find the link in person, they can always search for it through the Film & Media Website</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>First WordPress Page:</b> The first WordPress page was important because any user who needed access to what time the lab rooms were being used. They can click on the lab schedules tab on the film & media website and view it there. It was a process that wasn’t too difficult. I mainly used Google Calendars to implement the embedded code onto the multiple WordPress pages where each room would get its own page and once that was done I would copy and paste said code into the embedded area on the WordPress page and link each page onto the calendar navbar so it’s easy for users to access different room calendars.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Second WordPress Page:</b> The second page took a while to finish up for many different reasons. One was that I had to find a suitable plugin on WordPress so that the slideshow of students’ work that was being put on display was compatible with our current version of the app and that it displayed the images properly on the website with no issues whatsoever. In doing so I found multiple plugins but ended up using only one which allowed for many customizable features and allowed me to add all the images onto the slideshow with ease. If you’d like to see how it turned out then please take a look at it by clicking the 3rd image below the calendars and the poster</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Third WordPress Page:</b> The third page was relatively simple where I was given multiple youtube videos of student’s work from MEDP 366. I would then create a new portfolio page on WordPress where I would add the header, the text, and finally the content. The way adding YouTube videos on WordPress works is by clicking on the YouTube video going to the share link and grabbing the embedded code that could then be placed inside of the WordPress page. There’s a command where you can click on / and be able to search YouTube video and embed the video to the page so you’ll have a fully functional YouTube video which you can check out students’ work on the showcases below.</li>
