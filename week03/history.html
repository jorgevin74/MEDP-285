             <h2> Introduction:</h2>

             <p>In the next couple of sections we will discuss about the importance of the color Violet and a bit of it's history and how it has been used in different types of Media over the years. For starters Violet has a lot of meanings behind them with it being seen in positive and negative lights suchs as immaturity and gentleness for the positive side.</p>

             <h2> Fashion:</h2>

             <p>Violet is seen as a versatile color where you will see lighter shades of violet being used in spring/summer and darker shades in the fall/winter. We also see how it is actually used in products such as Gain Laundry Detergent as we saw previously how the color can be associated with gentleness and thats how you would want your clothes to feel like when you use a laundry detergent with a color like violet.</p>

             <h2>Concept:</h2>

             <p>Throughout history, the idea of violet being used is that it symbolizes power, prestige and spirituality so back then, Violet would be associated with royalty, nobility and love and would actually be influential to artists that feel a bit inspired by the color Violet and with that we will touch upon in the Art section.</p>

             <h2>Tv Shows:</h2>

             <p>The color Violet has been used in a lot of pieces of influential media, however the one that I can find that I personally enjoy is that Violet is one of the primary color of the influential anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The use of Violet is no accident as in the show there are a lot of symbolic messages that are shown to the viewer and almost everyone has their own interpretation of how the TV show represents realistic human emotions and how touching it can get. A lot of tv shows or anime in general have references to Evangelion and has one of the most iconic opening themes that is still played and referenced to this day after originally airing in October of 1995</p>

             <h2>Art:</h2>

             <p>In the Gallery, you'll see a drawing of a violet which shows how simple they are and also how popular they are because if you search up Violet art, you'll more than likely see a ton of drawings of Violets almost everywhere you search with the exception of maybe a different drawing that someone had. The reason as to why they are drawn alot is because of their asthetic appeal where it is very beautiful and pleasing to see. They also represent Love and Affection and are meaningful to artists who want to convey these themes into their art pieces</p>

             <h2>Nature:</h2>

             <p>You'll see the that there are in fact violet flowers belonging to the Viola family and a fun fact about them is that there are about 500 species of violets which can be found in many gardens around the wolrd and how they symbolize purity,, calmeness and of course spirituality as we mentioned before. The flower can be seen in the Gain Laundry Detergent cover as we've talked about before a certain type of violet, Lavender</p>

             <h2>Music:</h2>

             <p>Violet is seen in different album covers Purple Rain(although it is more purple hense the name but i will include it since Violet is a shade of purple) by Prince and alot of other album covers use Violet such as Graduation by Kanye West or Acid Rap by Chance The Rapper. Often more than enough the album covers and their choice of color will help you understand how the artists feel when they are making the album and they would give you a sense of understanding as to how you feel when you listen to these albums keeping in mind the album covers</p>
             
             <h2>Politics</h2>

             <p>Depending on the context, sometimes the color Violet is used to represent the "purple states" where there is neither political pary has a majority vote and they really dont lean to either side of the poltiics given which can be democratic or republican.</p>

             <h2>Science</h2>

             <p>Color therapy is a form of alternative medicine where they use colors and certain lights to treat patients with any physical or mental health conditions that they may be facing. The color violet is actually used because it is said to have a soothing and calming effect that can help a patient calm down and reduce their stress/anxiety </p>

             <h2>Technology</h2>

             <p>The color violet is used a lot for many technological reasons. it has a short wavelength ranging from (380-450nm) and is often used for devices that has lasers and those said lasers can actually help with storing important data into stuff such as Blu Ray Discs</p>
