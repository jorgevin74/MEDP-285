            <h2> Violet History</h2>

            <p>In this website, we are going to be going over the history of the color violet, how it came to be and taking a look at the many aspects in which violet is seen throughout different types of media and as well as taking a look at a couple of images that represent violet and would allow you the viewer to be able to appreciate violet and see it in a different light 
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                A small sneak peak into how violet is incoporated in media, it is the primary color of a machine called "Eva 01" in the hit 90's anime Neon Genesis Evangelion where the main character gets on to the machine and is able to pilot it to save the world. Although Eva 01 has multiple colors, it's primary is violet and was a solid choice because one of the negative meanings behind the color violet is immature and unstable and I would say that depicts the pilot of the eva, Shinji pretty well at the start of the show.
